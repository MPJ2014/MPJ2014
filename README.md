- 👋 Hi, I’m @MPJ2014, I am the CEO of LaTrueVie.com which is a new startup that will teach people French and English as well as connect Americans and French.
- 
- I am a non tech guy that has taught languages since 1992. I have managed excellent teams of English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Arabic, Chinese and Portueguese teachers and teaching methods  for my European language schools since 2002. I have had a lot of success in brick and mortar schools by working with people in person. Following the pandemic, and being obligated to move all of my students and teachers online, I have been brought back to my Silicon Valley tech roots. I want to give back to the tech that has given me so much. There are a lot of good SaaS language learning softwares in the market. I want to create what people want to learn French or English online and who want to do it with only one SaaS LaTrueVie.com

- 🌱 I’m currently working with my CTO on developing LaTrueVie.
- 
- 💞️ I have deep experience in the teaching languages and the language learning market field. I am a hustler and not a hacker.
