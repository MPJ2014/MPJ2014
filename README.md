- 👋 Hi, I’m @MPJ2014
- 👀 I’m interested in developing what people want in the next generation of language learning. For example, what people want to learn Spanish.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how to create a MRP (Minimum Remarkable Product) that we can give people what they want to learn Spanish.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this software. That said, although I have deep experience in the teaching languages/language learning market field, I am a hustler and not a hacker.
- 📫 How to reach me is here at github as I am discovering this space. Is this possible? Is this a place where only hackers meet or also where hackers meet hustlers?
